# 🌐 IoTBlockSim - Blockchain-IoT Simulation Platform  

*"The Internet of Things needs more than technology—it needs sustainable participation."*  

🔐 **Coming Soon**  
*Currently under academic review. After publication, the source code will be publicly available in [this repository](https://github.com/MohammadmahdiAhmadi/IoTBlockSim).*

## 🌟 Our Vision  
We're tackling one of IoT's biggest challenges:  
**How can we build self-sustaining networks where devices are continuously motivated to participate and share data?**  

Our platform serves as a research-focused foundation for exploring this question—merging blockchain technology with economic incentive models to foster robust and sustainable IoT ecosystems.
